I woke up at 7 am
I went to the bathroom to get dressed and put my contacts in. 
I went downstairs to eat breakfast.
I ate cereal, a waffle, and some fruit.
I got in the car to go to the game
My dad drove and handed me my water bottle.
We pulled out of the garage and drove towards the highway.
We made it to the field at 9 o'clock with the game to start at 10.
I grab my glove and wait for people to get to the field
We run to center field then stretch in the outfield
Then we all partner up and start throwing.
